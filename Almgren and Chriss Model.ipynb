    "# Almgren and Chriss Model For Optimal Execution of Portfolio Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the execution of portfolio transactions with the aim of minimizing a combination of risk and transaction costs arising from permanent and temporary market impact. As an example, assume that you have a certain number of stocks that you want to sell within a given time frame. If you place this sell order directly to the market as it is, transaction costs may rise due to temporary market impact. On the other hand, if you split up into pieces in time, cost may rise due to volatility in the stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Almgren and Chriss](https://cims.nyu.edu/~almgren/papers/optliq.pdf) provided a solution to this problem by assuming the permanent and temporary market impact functions are linear functions of the rate of trading, and that stock prices follow a discrete arithmetic random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take a look at the model used by Almgren and Chriss to solve the optimal liquidation problem. We will start by stating the formal definitions of *trading trajectory*, *trading list*, and *trading strategy* for liquidating a single stock.\n",

In their model, Almgren and Chriss distinguish between two types of market impact, permanent and temporary market impact. We will now add these two factors into our price model.\n",

    "### Permanent Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Permanent market impact refers to changes in the equilibrium price of a stock as a direct function of our trading. Permanent market impact is called *permanent* because its effect persists for the entire liquidation period, $T$. We will denote the permanent price impact as $g(v)$, and will add it to our price model:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "This is what we seek to minimize when determining the best trading strategy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since $\\xi_k$ is random, so is the implementation shortfall. Therefore, we have to frame the minimization problem in terms of the expectation value of the shortfall and its corresponding variance. We'll refer to $E(x)$ as the expected shortfall and $V(x)$ as the variance of the shortfall. Simplifying the above equation for $I_s$, is easy to see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E(x) = \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{N} \\tau x_k g\\left(\\frac{n_k}{\\tau}\\right) + \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{N} n_k h\\left(\\frac{n_k}{\\tau}\\right)\n",

    "For a given level of variance of shortfall, $V(x)$, we seek to minimize the expectation of shortfall, $E(x)$. In the next section we will see how to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utility Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal now is to find the strategy that has the minimum expected shortfall $E(x)$ for a given maximum level of variance $V(x) \\ge 0$. This constrained optimization problem can be solved by introducing a Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$. Therefore, our problem reduces to finding the trading strategy that minimizes the **Utility Function** $U(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "U(x) = E(x) + \\lambda V(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\lambda$ is referred to as **trader’s risk aversion** and controls how much we penalize the variance relative to the expected shortfall.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition of this utility function can be thought of as follows. Consider a stock which exhibits high price volatility and thus a high risk of price movement away from the equilibrium price. A risk averse trader would prefer to trade a large portion of the volume immediately, causing a known price impact, rather than risk trading in small increments at successively adverse prices. Alternatively, if the price is expected to be stable over the liquidation period, the trader would rather split the trade into smaller sizes to avoid price impact. This trade-off between speed of execution and risk of price movement is ultimately what governs the structure of the resulting trade list.\n",
